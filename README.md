# React Native Payment Screen Demo

This project is a small demo app built with **React Native (Expo)** as part of a take home assignment.  
The goal is to show how the same Payment screen can be reused for both **Domestic** and **International** transfers.

---

## Features

- Single `PaymentScreen` reused for both flows
- Radio button to switch between **Domestic** and **International**
- Form validation handled with `react-hook-form` + `yup`
- Different validation rules depending on the transfer type  
  - Domestic: recipient name, account number, amount  
  - International: same as above + IBAN, SWIFT code
- When switching tab, the form resets and auto focuses back on **Recipient Name**
- "Send Payment" button is fixed at the bottom
- All data is mocked (no API calls)

---

## Tech stack

- React Native (Expo)
- react-hook-form
- yup
